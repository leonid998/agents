## Introduction
The YAML configuration standard provides a consistent structure for defining subagents across the VoltAgent ecosystem. This standardized format ensures uniformity in agent definitions, enabling seamless integration, automated processing, and reliable tooling support. By adhering to a common schema, subagents maintain interoperability across different environments and workflows while simplifying adoption and maintenance.

## Standardized YAML Front Matter Structure
All subagent configuration files follow a standardized YAML front matter structure enclosed by triple dashes (`---`). This structure defines essential metadata and capabilities at the beginning of each agent definition file. The consistent placement and format enable automated parsing and validation across the entire agent collection.

The front matter serves as a machine-readable header that specifies the agent's identity, purpose, and tool access, while the subsequent content provides detailed behavioral instructions and operational protocols.

## Core Configuration Fields
The standardized YAML configuration includes three essential fields that define each subagent's fundamental characteristics.

### name
The `name` field specifies the unique identifier for the subagent, used for invocation and reference within the system. This value must be lowercase, hyphen-separated, and globally unique across all agents.

- [devops-engineer.md](file://devops-engineer.md#L1)

### description
The `description` field provides a concise summary of the subagent's capabilities and specialization. It follows a consistent pattern: "Expert [role] specializing in [primary focus]. Masters [key technologies] with focus on [value proposition]."

- [devops-engineer.md](file://devops-engineer.md#L2)

### tools
The `tools` field lists the MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools accessible to the subagent, determining its operational capabilities. Tools are specified as a comma-separated list, with capitalization preserved as defined in the MCP specification.

## Schema Implementation Examples
The consistency of the YAML schema is demonstrated through real-world examples from the agent collection.

### backend-developer Configuration
```yaml
---
name: backend-developer
description: Senior backend engineer specializing in scalable API development and microservices architecture. Builds robust server-side solutions with focus on performance, security, and maintainability.
tools: Read, Write, MultiEdit, Bash, Docker, database, redis, postgresql
---
```

### devops-engineer Configuration
```yaml
---
name: devops-engineer
description: Expert DevOps engineer bridging development and operations with comprehensive automation, monitoring, and infrastructure management. Masters CI/CD, containerization, and cloud platforms with focus on culture, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
tools: Read, Write, MultiEdit, Bash, docker, kubernetes, terraform, ansible, prometheus, jenkins
---
```

Both configurations follow the identical structure, demonstrating the standardized schema implementation across different domains.

## Tooling Support and Validation
The standardized YAML structure enables robust tooling support and automated validation processes.

### Automated Processing
The consistent schema allows for automated extraction of agent metadata, enabling:
- Dynamic agent registry generation
- Capability-based agent discovery
- Tool usage analytics
- Cross-agent dependency mapping
- Automated documentation generation

### Validation Mechanisms
Validation tools can verify configuration integrity by checking for:
- Required fields presence
- Proper YAML syntax
- Valid tool names against MCP specification
- Naming convention compliance
- Description format consistency

## Best Practices for Configuration Extension
When extending configurations, maintain backward compatibility and adhere to established patterns.

### Safe Extension Patterns
- Add new fields after the standard front matter
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document new fields in the agent body
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow the same formatting rules

### Versioning Strategy
For significant changes, implement versioning through:
- Optional fields with default values
- Backward-compatible additions
- Clear deprecation notices
- Migration guides in documentation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Address common configuration problems with systematic approaches.

### YAML Syntax Errors
Common syntax issues include:
- Improper indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
- Missing or extra colons in key-value pairs
- Unquoted special characters
- Improper list formatting
- Unclosed quotes

### Schema Mismatches
Prevent schema mismatches by:
- Verifying field names against the standard
- Ensuring required fields are present
- Validating tool names against MCP specification
- Checking case sensitivity in tool names
- Confirming proper separator usage

### Tool Integration Failures
Resolve tool integration issues by:
- Verifying tool availability in the MCP environment
- Checking tool name spelling and case
- Ensuring proper tool configuration
- Validating agent permissions
- Testing tool access in isolated environment
