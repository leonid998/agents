## Introduction
The subagent categorization system organizes specialized AI agents into ten distinct categories based on their primary functions and expertise domains. This structured approach enhances discoverability, maintainability, and effective utilization of agents across the software development lifecycle. Each category serves specific roles and aligns with particular phases of development, enabling teams to efficiently select and coordinate the right agents for their tasks.

## Categorization Rationale
The categorization system was designed to support discoverability and maintainability through several key principles:

```mermaid
classDiagram
class Category {
+String name
+String description
+Subagent[] subagents
+alignWithSDLCPhase()
+supportTeamRoles()
+enableDiscoverability()
}
class Subagent {
+String name
+String description
+Tool[] tools
+getCapabilities()
+handleTask()
}
class SDLCPhase {
+String name
+Category[] associatedCategories
+getResponsibleAgents()
}
class TeamRole {
+String name
+Category[] alignedCategories
+getSupportingAgents()
}
Category "1" *-- "0..*" Subagent : contains
SDLCPhase "1" *-- "0..*" Category : associates with
TeamRole "1" *-- "0..*" Category : aligns with
Category --> SDLCPhase : aligns with
Category --> TeamRole : supports
```

**Diagram sources**

- [agent-organizer.md](file://agent-organizer.md#L0-L43)

**Section sources**
- [README.md](file://README.md#L50-L205)
- [agent-organizer.md](file://agent-organizer.md#L0-L43)

The categorization system provides several benefits:
- **Discoverability**: Users can easily find agents by functional area rather than searching through a flat list of hundreds of agents
- **Maintainability**: Categories provide natural groupings for updates, improvements, and versioning
- **Onboarding**: New users can understand the agent ecosystem by exploring categories relevant to their needs
- **Workflow Design**: Teams can design multi-agent workflows by selecting agents from appropriate categories based on SDLC phase
- **Scalability**: The system can accommodate new agents by placing them in existing categories or creating new ones as needed

The ten-category structure balances specificity with manageability, ensuring that each category has a clear scope while covering the complete spectrum of software development activities.
