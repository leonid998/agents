## Requirements Gathering and Prioritization

The business-analyst agent employs structured techniques to gather and validate requirements. Methods include stakeholder interviews, document analysis, use case development, and workshop facilitation. Requirements are documented with traceability, acceptance criteria, and version control.

Prioritization follows a data-driven approach:
- **SWOT Analysis**: Assesses strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluates ROI and resource investment
- **Kano Model**: Classifies features by user satisfaction impact
- **Value vs Complexity Matrix**: Balances business value against implementation effort

Requirements are refined iteratively and validated through prototypes, mockups, and user feedback loops.

## Value Measurement and Product-Market Fit

Achieving product-market fit requires measuring both user satisfaction and business outcomes. Key metrics include:
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer loyalty
- **DAU/MAU Ratio**: Indicates engagement levels
- **Churn Rate**: Tracks customer retention
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Evaluates profitability
- **Feature Adoption Rate**: Assesses value realization

The product-manager, data-analyst, and customer-success-manager agents jointly analyze these metrics to refine strategy, improve retention, and scale growth.
