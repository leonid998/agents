## Integration Patterns

### Full-Stack Type Safety
The nextjs-developer collaborates with the typescript-pro to ensure end-to-end type safety in full-stack applications. The typescript-pro establishes shared type definitions and type-safe API contracts, while the nextjs-developer implements server components with proper type validation and error handling.

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Language-Specific Optimization
Each language specialist applies ecosystem-specific performance techniques:

- **python-pro**: Uses NumPy vectorization, Cython for critical paths, and async I/O optimization
- **rust-engineer**: Implements zero-allocation APIs, SIMD intrinsics, and const evaluation
- **golang-pro**: Applies object pooling with sync.Pool and zero-allocation techniques
- **cpp-pro**: Uses cache-friendly algorithms, SIMD intrinsics, and lock-free data structures
- **typescript-pro**: Optimizes build performance with project references and tree shaking

## Decision Guidance

### Framework-Specific vs Generalist Agents
Use framework-specific agents when:

- Building applications with complex framework-specific requirements
- Needing advanced optimization techniques unique to the framework
- Requiring deep expertise in framework-specific patterns and best practices
- Implementing performance-critical components

Use generalist agents when:

- Building simple applications with basic requirements
- Prototyping or proof-of-concept development
- Working with multiple technologies in a single application
- Needing broad architectural guidance

- [dotnet-core-expert.md](file://dotnet-core-expert.md#L1-L296)

### Version-Specific Considerations
The distinction between dotnet-framework-4.8-expert and dotnet-core-expert highlights important version-specific considerations:

- **dotnet-framework-4.8-expert**: Specializes in legacy Windows-only applications, Web Forms, and WCF services
- **dotnet-core-expert**: Focuses on cross-platform development, minimal APIs, and cloud-native applications

Choose based on deployment requirements, platform constraints, and performance needs.
