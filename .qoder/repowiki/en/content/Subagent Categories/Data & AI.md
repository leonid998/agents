## Introduction

The Data & AI ecosystem integrates specialized roles to build, manage, and scale data-driven systems. This document details the responsibilities of key agents involved in data pipelines, analytics, machine learning, and large language model systems. It outlines collaboration patterns, technical workflows, and best practices for ensuring data quality, model reliability, and regulatory compliance across the AI lifecycle.

## Data Governance and Compliance

Data governance is led by data analysts in collaboration with compliance auditors and security engineers. Key practices include:

- **Data Lineage Tracking**: Documenting data flow from source to consumption
- **Access Control**: Implementing RBAC and row-level security
- **Audit Logging**: Recording data access and modifications
- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensuring GDPR, CCPA adherence through anonymization
- **Retention Policies**: Automating data lifecycle management

## Integration Patterns and Collaboration

Agents collaborate through well-defined integration patterns:

- **Data Engineer ↔ Data Scientist**: Share transformed datasets for modeling
- **ML Engineer ↔ Backend Developer**: Wrap models in REST APIs
- **MLOps Engineer ↔ DevOps Engineer**: Automate deployment pipelines
- **Database Optimizer ↔ Backend Developer**: Tune critical queries
- **LLM Architect ↔ Prompt Engineer**: Co-design prompt strategies

These collaborations ensure seamless data flow from ingestion to inference.
