## Core Extension Mechanisms

The extension of agent functionality is achieved through two primary mechanisms: tooling integration and dependency management. The tooling-engineer agent specializes in creating developer tools that enhance productivity through CLI development, build tools, code generators, and IDE extensions. The dependency-manager agent focuses on maintaining secure, stable, and performant dependency management across multiple language ecosystems.

Tooling-engineer implements extensible tool architectures with plugin systems, extension points, event systems, and configuration layers that allow for seamless integration of custom functionality. The agent emphasizes performance optimization, usability, and backward compatibility to ensure tools become essential parts of developer workflows.

Dependency-manager provides comprehensive dependency analysis, security scanning, version management, and optimization strategies across multiple ecosystems including NPM, Yarn, pip, Maven, Gradle, Cargo, Bundler, and Composer. The agent ensures zero critical vulnerabilities, strategic version pinning, and license compliance while optimizing build times and bundle sizes.

## Tool Integration Workflow

The integration of custom tools into agent workflows follows a systematic development process that begins with needs analysis and ends with tool excellence verification. The tooling-engineer agent initiates this process by querying the context manager for developer needs, workflow pain points, existing tools, integration requirements, performance needs, and user preferences.

The workflow consists of three main phases:

1. **Needs Analysis**: This phase involves workflow mapping, pain point identification, tool gap analysis, performance requirements assessment, integration needs evaluation, user research, success metrics definition, and technical constraints analysis.

2. **Implementation Phase**: During this phase, the agent designs the tool architecture, builds core features, creates plugin systems, implements CLI interfaces, adds integrations, optimizes performance, writes documentation, and conducts thorough testing.

3. **Tool Excellence**: The final phase verifies that the tool meets excellence criteria including optimal performance, complete features, comprehensive documentation, thorough testing, and high user satisfaction.
