## ü§ñ Understanding Subagents

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that enhance Claude Code's capabilities by providing task-specific expertise. They act as dedicated helpers that Claude Code can call upon when encountering particular types of work.

### What Makes Subagents Special?

**Independent Context Windows**  
Every subagent operates within its own isolated context space, preventing cross-contamination between different tasks and maintaining clarity in the primary conversation thread.

**Domain-Specific Intelligence**  
Subagents come equipped with carefully crafted instructions tailored to their area of expertise, resulting in superior performance on specialized tasks.

**Shared Across Projects**  
After creating a subagent, you can utilize it throughout various projects and distribute it among team members to ensure consistent development practices.

**Granular Tool Permissions**  
You can configure each subagent with specific tool access rights, enabling fine-grained control over which capabilities are available for different task types.

### Core Advantages

- **Memory Efficiency**: Isolated contexts prevent the main conversation from becoming cluttered with task-specific details
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Specialized prompts and configurations lead to better results in specific domains
- **Workflow Consistency**: Team-wide subagent sharing ensures uniform approaches to common tasks
- **Security Control**: Tool access can be restricted based on subagent type and purpose

### Getting Started with Subagents

**1. Access the Subagent Manager**
```bash
/agents
```

**2. Create Your Subagent**
- Choose between project-specific or global subagents
- Let Claude generate an initial version, then refine it to your needs
- Provide detailed descriptions of the subagent's purpose and activation triggers
- Configure tool access (leave empty to inherit all available tools)
- Customize the system prompt using the built-in editor (press `e`)

**3. Deploy and Utilize**
Your subagent becomes immediately available. Claude Code will automatically engage it when suitable, or you can explicitly request its help:
```
> Have the code-reviewer subagent analyze my latest commits
```

### Subagent Storage Locations

| Type | Path | Availability | Precedence |
|------|------|--------------|------------|
| Project Subagents | `.claude/agents/` | Current project only | Higher |
| Global Subagents | `~/.claude/agents/` | All projects | Lower |

Note: When naming conflicts occur, project-specific subagents override global ones.



## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use Subagents

### Setting Up in Claude Code
1. Place subagent files in `.claude/agents/` within your project
2. Claude Code automatically detects and loads the subagents
3. Invoke them naturally in conversation or let Claude decide when to use them

### Creating New Subagents - Step by Step

**Step 1: Launch the Agent Interface**
```bash
/agents
```

**Step 2: Choose "Create New Agent"**
- Decide on project-level (current project) or user-level (all projects) scope

**Step 3: Configure Your Agent**
- **Recommended approach**: Let Claude draft an initial version, then customize
- Write a comprehensive description of the agent's role and activation scenarios  
- Grant specific tool permissions (or leave blank for full access)
- Browse available tools through the interface for easy selection
- Edit the system prompt directly by pressing `e` for advanced customization

**Step 4: Save and Start Using**
- Your agent is instantly ready for use
- Claude automatically delegates appropriate tasks to it
- Or manually invoke it:
```
> Ask the code-reviewer agent to examine my pull request
```

## üìñ Subagent Structure
